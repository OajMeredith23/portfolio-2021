description: POVision is an interactive video experience that allows the viewer
  to experience an ice hockey match from the point of view of any player they
  chose, in real-time.

brief: Recommended to me by a tutor, I was approached by a group of filmmakers
  to help bring their vision for an interactive sports viewing experience to
  life.  <br/> <br/> They wanted to take multi-camera footage that they'd
  recorded and use it to create an environment in which the viewer can choose a
  specific player from whose viewpoint they wanted to watch, when they wanted.
solution: With a clear vision of what they wanted to build, the challenges I had
  to overcome were technical. This project meant managing multiple videos,
  switching between them seamlessly, and changing the UI to display information
  about both the game score at the current time in the video, as well as
  information specific to the players whose point of view is currently on
  screen.  <br/> <br/> At this point in early 2019 I knew that the way React.js
  manages state would be perfect, I just didn't know how to use it. I went from
  no previous experience using React to deploying POVision in the space of two
  weeks, ultimately building something that was proudly displayed as part of the
  filmmakers final year degree show.
