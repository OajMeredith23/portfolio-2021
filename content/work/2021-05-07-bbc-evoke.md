brief: This brief asked us to create a <i>“new customer experience to help the
  BBC’s audience fit the BBC into their daily lives, tailored and optimised to
  where they are and the device they are using”.</i> This meant thinking deeply
  about the scenarios in which users access BBC services, how they do so, and
  how can we expand that experience in a unique, exciting way.
solution: >+
  Our solution category-winning solution, <i>BBC Evoke,</i> takes the users
  immediate experience —via real-time video and sound— and uses it to curate
  unique collections of content that are perfectly suited to their current
  environment. 


  Our concept uses object recognition technology to recognise the users' environment and select BBC content that relates specifically to those observations. This experience is transparent; the user is always given feedback on how their content is being curated, avoiding the need for intrusive data collection.
